This information also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose.

  %h3 How We Protect Information Online

  %p We exercise great care to protect your personal information. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via email since we have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us since email does not have the security features that are built into our websites.

  %p In addition, we limit Fixus' employees and contractors' access to personal information. Only those employees and contractors with a business reason to know have access to this information. We educate our employees about the importance of maintaining confidentiality of customer information.
  We review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate.

  %p If you are using the Fixus website for which you registered and choose a password, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.

This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if others have access to your computer.
